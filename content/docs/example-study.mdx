This is an example MDX scientific document for Kaffeepedia. It demonstrates frontmatter, math rendering, and a short article structure.

## Abstract

We aim to describe a simple relationship used in extraction theory for espresso and filter coffee.

## A key equation

Below is a small inline equation and a displayed equation rendered with KaTeX:

Inline example: The brew ratio is given as $R = \frac{m_{water}}{m_{coffee}}$.

Displayed equation:

$$
E = 100 \times \left(1 - e^{-\frac{k \cdot t}{m}}\right)
$$

where E is extraction percentage, k is a rate constant, t is time, and m is mass.
